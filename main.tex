    \section{Introuction}

    Watching movies has become one of the most popular ways of entertainment and there are hundreds and thousands of new movies produced every year.
    An average person could have watched dozens or hundreds of movies.
    It is not rare for someone to bump into an annoying situation when they could only remember a rough story or some segments of the movie, but just could not recall its name.

    In this project, we aim at helping people to retrieve the film they want when they forget the title and could only remember a part of the story.
    We have designed and implemented a search engine to find corresponding movies with description or keywords provided by the user.
